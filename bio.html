    <h1>Warren Clark</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I come from a background in Private Equity and Investment Banking where I worked as an Analyst for Winchester Advisors and Talley & Company.  After the Recession in 2009 I relocated to Santa Barbara and have spent the last ten years managing Restaurants/Nightclubs; as well as building numerous lighting installations involving LEDs and fiber optics.  After the closure of the industry due to Covid I have now shifted gears towards software development and am looking forward to starting a new career as such.</p>
