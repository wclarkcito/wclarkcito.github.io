                <p>From a very young age I was exposed to a great deal of travel.  Having grown up in Southern California it would have been easy to settle into the beach lifestyle; however it was important to my parents that I get out and learn how the rest of the world lived. Thus, by the age of eighteen I had been in and out of several countries most of which would be classified as second or even third world.  Having also learned Russian at a very young age I spent time in Yalta during the early nineties translating at the latter stages of the Cold War. Shortly after High School I spent six months in Ammand, Jordan on an archeological dig before attending Oxford University for a year to study Literature.  After finishing up College in the states I relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting.  It did not take me long to realize that I was not going to take Hollywood by storm so I began working in Private Equity and Investment Banking as an Analyst for a small Broker/Dealer.  Once the Recession in 2009 descended upon us the financial landscape changed with regards to my employers so I relocated to Santa Barbara and have spent the last ten years managing Restaurants/Nightclubs.  Like many other businesses the hospitality industry plummeted at the hands of Covid-19, so I am now learning web-development through a coding bootcamp at UC Davis.
