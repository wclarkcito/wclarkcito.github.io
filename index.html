          <p id="bioText">From a very young age I was exposed to a great deal of travel. Having grown up in
            Southern
            California it would have been easy to settle into the beach lifestyle; however it was
            important to my parents that I get out and learn how the rest of the world lived. Thus,
            by
            the age of eighteen I had traveled in and out of several countries most of which would
            be
            classified as second or third world. Having also learned Russian at a very young age I
            spent time in Yalta and Moscow during the early nineties translating at the latter
            stages of
            the Cold War. Shortly after High School I spent six months in Ammand, Jordan on an
            archeological dig
            before attending Oxford University for a year to study Literature. After finishing up
            College in the states I relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. It did
            not
            take me long to realize that I was not going to take Hollywood by storm so I began
            working
            in Private Equity and Investment Banking as an Analyst for a small Broker/Dealer. Once
            the
            Recession in 2009 descended upon us the financial landscape changed with regards to my
            employers so I relocated to Santa Barbara and have spent the last ten years managing
            Restaurants/Nightclubs. Like many other businesses the hospitality industry plummeted at
            the
            hands of Covid-19, so I am now enrolled in a Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at UC
            Davis pursuing a career in Full Stack Web Development.</p>
